# Albums (WIP)

Simple project for the purpose of learning React Native

To build and run the app, run:
1. `npm install`
2. Copy `src/config/config.js.example` into `src/config/config.js`
3. To run on:
    - device, run `npm run start:[device: oneOf(['ios', 'android'])]:device "[device name]"`;
    - simulator, run `npm run start:[device: oneOf(['ios', 'android'])]:simulator`.
    
In order to run project on your device, you might want to follow
the [instructions](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-device) on how to connect your device
so it is visible for the computer.
